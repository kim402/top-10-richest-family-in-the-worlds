<p>The three most prominent living members (Jim, Rob, and Alice Walton) have consistently been in the top twenty of the Forbes 400 list since 2001, as were John (d. 2005) and Helen (d. 2007) prior to their deaths. Christy Walton took her husband John's place in the ranking after his death. The majority of the family's wealth derives from the heritage of Bud and Sam Walton, who were the co-founders of Walmart. Walmart is the world's largest retailer, one of the world's largest business enterprises in terms of annual revenue, and, with just over 2.2 million employees, the world's largest private employer.

As of December 2014, the Waltons collectively owned 50.8 percent of Walmart.[4] In 2018, the family sold some of their company's stock and now owns just under 50%.[5] In August 2024, the Walton family's net worth was around US$ 324.2 billion.</p>
